# fanapponly
Here lies my fan app only :)
1. I have a splash screen that I made as a vector and used the loading screen as the splash screen. Lasts for maybe 2-3 seconds
2. Next I created a simple page where you just login to using your Google Account and it is Authenticated using Firebase
3. The User is stored into the Firebase Database and the user can log in and log out with their information saved
